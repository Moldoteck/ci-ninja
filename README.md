# ci-ninja
CI service written in node for docker containers, inspired by [ci-ninja](https://github.com/backmeupplz/ci-ninja)

# Usage
1. `git clone https://github.com/Moldoteck/ci-ninja` on the server
2. Add repository names and docker container names, as well as root folder, like:
```
let docker_name = ''
if (payload.repository.name.includes('TestRepo'))
  docker_name = 'testrepo'
...
exec('sudo docker-compose restart ' + line, { cwd: '../RootFolder' }, execCallback)
```
3. Add ci-ninja.service
4. Add Webhook from your GitHub repository to `http://{server-ip}:61439/`

TODO: explain how webhook should be added
TODO: repo and container names should be in an JSON file
TODO: explain easiest way to create service for debian/ubuntu
TODO: explain how to deal with IP in google cloud
